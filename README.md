# Portfolio Website

## About
This repository hosts the source code for my website, [rafi-codes.dev](https://www.rafi-codes.dev). The website was
built primarily with Node.js and Express.

## How It Works
* Page routing is handled through Express
* Front-end is done using plain HTML and custom CSS (minimal Bootstrap used)
* Contact form mail handling is done using Nodemailer and Google APIs
* Typing animation and live clock on homepage was implemented using custom JavaScript 
* Particles are provided with particles.js

## Current Plans
* Make site responsive for mobile users
* Develop a more modern looking user interface
* Create animations for page transitions 
* Implement version 2.0 using Next.js
