# Portfolio Website

## About
This repository hosts the source code for my website, [rafi-codes.dev](https://www.rafi-codes.dev). This version
was built using Node.js and Bootstrap.

## How It Works
* Page routing is handled through Express
* Front-end is implemented with plain HTML and custom CSS (minimal Bootstrap used)
* Express Back-end + Nodemailer + Google APIs handle email form submissions
* Custom JavaScript is used to implement the typing animation and live clock on the homepage
* Particles are provided with particles.js

## Current Plans
* Make site responsive for mobile users
* Develop a more modern looking user interface
* Create animations for page transitions
* Implement version 2.0 using Next.js
